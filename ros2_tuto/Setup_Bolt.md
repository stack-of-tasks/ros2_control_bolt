# BOLT TUTORIAL :
## SETUP

After you've follow the the Start tutorial you need to know how to setup Bolt, that will take you 3 steps :

* Bolt skeleton
* How to plug correctly Bolt
* How to setup somes informations for bolt 



##  1)  Bolt Skeleton :

Bolt is a tiny robot completely built in our labs. We have assemblate their components, modeled their bones with a 3D printer and made it look like real robots. 

  - If one day, one of their bones broke you will need to go to this link and follow the tutorial. You will have to print a new bone for Bolt with a 3D Printer :

##  2)  Plug Bolt properly :

1) You need before any commands who need Bolt have it properly connected. Is really simple that what you need :

    - An alimentation,
    - A pc with ubuntu 20.04 and 2 or more ethernet port,
    - An emergency stop button,
    - A power cable. 

2) Take your alimentation, put them on and adjust behind alimentation the port (P1/P2/P3) and put the mode to SET then set the Voltage to 20V and amperage 5A. Finally change the mode to NORMAL.

3) Connect the emergency stop button to the alimentation (by behind not front).

4) Connect the power cable to Bolt, one end to the ethernet port of the Master-Board and the power cable inside Bolt.

5) See if any cable is plugged out of the Master-Board (below Bolt).

6) Connect the other end to the emergency button and the ethernet cable to your pc.

7) Finally unpress the emergency stop button and power on the alimentation.

   - If you see a Red-Light flash below Bolt, it means Bolt is ON


**Now Bolt is connected properly to your computer.**


## 3) Set some important information on Bolt :

1) You need to set the internet port of Bolt in the code. 

   - Open a Terminal and run :

          ifconfig

2) All the name ports start with "en" you can see them on the left of your terminal.

    - Power ON Bolt.

    - Open a new Terminal go in your Bolt_ws file and source your ROS 2 :

          source install/setup.bash'

     - Try one by one all the port with this command,  <PORT> is a value where you change the port name :

            ros2 run --prefix="sudo -E env PATH=${PATH} LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}" ros2_hardware_interface_bolt demo_bolt_sensor_reading <PORT>
3) When you haven't an error and you have some values returned you have found the correct port.    

      - Copy paste the right port in the file :
  
             Bolt_ws/src/ros2_control_bolt/ros2_hardware_interface_bolt/test/config_bolt.yaml 
        at :
  
              interface : <PORT>     (line 4) 

4) Save your file and now you donâ€™t need to put the port name in every command you send to Bolt. 

    **Now you have seen how you put the correct ethernet Port in the code.**
  
### Your next step is to run some tests to see how the Bolt works.
